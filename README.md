### convert_graph.py

Input should be .txt or .csv file. In these files, each row has the number of two nodes which are connected, and they should be separeted by space or tab. 

Output will be a binary file which represents the list representation of a graph.

### exact_dinic.py

Solve DSP with max-flow based algorithm.

### charikar_greedy.py

Solve DSP with Charikar's greedy peeling algorithm. The output graph of this algorithm has at least 1/2 as dence as the densest subgraph.

### greedy_pp.py 

Solve DSP with GREEDY++. The output of the first iteration is same as Charikar's greedy peeling algorithm.

### jaccard.py

Calculate jaccard similarity coefficient(simirality of two sets).

### for_test.py

Wrapper
